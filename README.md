# Blog Platform

A full-stack blog platform built with React and JSON Server. This application allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts.

## Features

- View all blog posts
- Create new blog posts
- Edit existing blog posts
- Delete blog posts
- View individual blog post details
- Responsive design with Bootstrap

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, React Router, Axios, Bootstrap
- **Backend**: JSON Server
- **Data**: JSON file-based database

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

You need to run both the backend server and the React app:

1. **Start the JSON Server (Backend)**:
   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```
   This will start the JSON Server on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

2. **Start the React App (Frontend)**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This will start the React app on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the React app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run server`

Starts the JSON Server backend on port 5000.\
The API will be available at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
